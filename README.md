# Exploratory data analysis of the Leukemia gene expression

# Problem statement 
Researchers in genomics are frequently interested in understanding how their samples are related to one another and how different variables in the data set are correlated. They usually want to answer the following questions: Are our replicates similar to each other? Do the samples from the same treatment group have similar genome-wide signals? Do the patients with similar diseases have similar gene expression profiles?. From these informations, one can develop an hypothesis, identify outliers in the sample, or determine which sample groups require more data points. In this perspective, the project goal is to do an exploratory data analysis of the Leukemia gene expression to answer some scientists' questions.
