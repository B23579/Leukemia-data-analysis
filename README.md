# Exploratory data analysis of the Leukemia gene expression

# Problem statement 
Researchers in genomics are frequently interested in understanding how their samples are related to one another and how variables in the data set are related to one another. They usually want to answer the following questions: Are our replicates similar to each other? Do the samples from the same treatment group have similar genome-wide signals? Do the patients with similar diseases have similar gene expression profiles?. Using these points of information, one can develop a hypothesis, identify outliers in the sample, or determine which sample groups require more data points. Therefore, the goal of this project is to do an exploratory data analysis of the Leukemia gene expression to answer some scientists' questions.
